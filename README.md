This machine learning project involves the analysis of a dataset without converting categorical columns to numeric values. Key steps include:

Data Exploration:
Analyzing the dataset's shape, columns, and exploring age-related statistics.
Investigating work class and income distribution for insights.

Data Visualization:
Creating bar charts to visualize education levels and generating pie charts for sex and marital status.

Data Manipulation:
Renaming and selecting relevant columns, dropping unnecessary ones.
Handling null and duplicate values to ensure data integrity.

Data Preprocessing:
Transforming categorical columns into numeric using label encoding techniques.
Scaling features for uniformity using StandardScaler.

Model Training:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Utilizing logistic regression, linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models for predictions.

Hyperparameter Tuning:
Employing grid search for optimizing model performance.

Prediction:
Using the trained models to predict income class for new entries.

This project showcases proficiency in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model implementation for classificationÂ tasks.
